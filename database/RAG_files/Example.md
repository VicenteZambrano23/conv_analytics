At Cognizant, innovation is a mindset. Over the past decade, Delivery Excellence’s Continuous Improvement & Innovation program created a solid foundation for innovation. We’re expanding on that success to include new methods, processes and templates, and new ways to recognize and reward associates for their contributions.

 

We’ve practiced it for years
Over the past decade, Delivery Excellence’s Continuous Improvement & Innovation program created a solid foundation for innovation. We’re expanding on that success to include new methods, processes and templates, and new ways to recognize and reward associates for their contributions.

 

We call it Bluebolt
We have relaunched and broadened the highly productive Continuous Improvement & Innovation program under a new name - Bluebolt

 

Bluebolt is a reference to “a bolt from the blue,” meaning something important that can come from anyone or anywhere, arriving seemingly “out of the blue,” like a bolt of inspiration. That’s the heart and soul of innovation at Cognizant.

 

Solving problems, looking for unmet or latent client needs, challenging the status quo, imagining a better future—these are all aspects of operating with a growth mindset. Bluebolt will serve as Cognizant’s innovation engine, fueled by associates' ideas. It will leverage 'Bluebolt Central' - Cognizant's innovation management platform, robust processes, and newer innovation methods. We intend to convert ideas into working prototypes, from there we will seek to monetize those ideas and generate value for clients.

 

What this means for you
The Bluebolt movement is targeted at every project/program and will be amplified with methods, templates, recognition, awards, and a repeatable, scalable process to leverage ideas across the organization:

Scaled associate enablement and training
Theme-based opportunity identification and idea generation
Repeatable ideas, feeding a repository of innovation assets
Innovation hubs to convert ideas into working prototypes
Rewards and recognition
Client talking points
 

Given the importance of this initiative to our clients and global associates, our CEO, Ravi, will be the executive sponsor.  For more information and answers to questions you may have (related to Bluebolt process, measurement, learning and more), refer the Bluebolt FAQs available here.




Ravi Kumar and Gaurav Chand talk about the power of building a grassroots innovation movement 

Bluebolt inspiration hub
Inspiration is not just for the creatives among us – it’s for all of us. When we’re inspired, we question, experiment, and challenge the status quo. Even Bluebolt, Cognizant’s grassroots innovation initiative, refers to something important that can come from anyone or anywhere, arriving seemingly “out of the blue,” like a bolt of inspiration. That’s the heart and soul of innovation at Cognizant.

 

Ravi Kumar S recently announced a new goal of 500,000 Bluebolt ideas by the end of 2024. With this in mind, we know that inspiration is the start of innovation – so here’s how to get started on submitting your ideas.
 



I have an idea, now what?
Once you have your idea, see how far it can go!

Start by submitting it to Bluebolt Central, contributing to our goal of 500,000 ideas.
Get involved in the Bluebolt AI for Sustainability Ideathon, with two main themes centered around both clients and Cognizant.
Build your innovation muscle
Take a design thinking or Bluebolt overview course and join the 220,000+ associates that have already done so. 

 

Then, listen to a Trusted Voices podcast episode with Prabha Anand and Ravishankar Ganesan. 

Our tips & tricks for innovating
Dedicate time for innovation: Block time on your calendar so you can brainstorm without interruption. Close your email, Teams, and anything else that could distract you, and focus on your idea.

Explore the Bluebolt innovation assistant: Use this AI assistant to help you brainstorm. You can ask it things like “Can you give me ideas on demand forecasting?” or “what are the trending innovations in Healthcare?”

Use the “5 Whys Analysis” method: Inspired by curious toddlers, this technique involves asking “why” repeatedly. Start with a specific issue, ask “why?” 5 times, and you’ll find an underlying issue you can solve for.

Be inspired by innovation masters: Read about the SPE service line, who has been credited with the highest Bluebolt idea generation. Maybe their solutions will spark your own idea!

Brainstorm with your team: Set up time with your team to talk about problems on your project and brainstorm solutions. Keep an open mind, and you may have the next winning Bluebolt idea.
