'''This agent formulates a search query based on the user's question and calls the `retrieve_tool` to find relevant information within its specialized document collection. It should be called **only when the user's question cannot be answered by querying the SQL database and is highly likely to be directly and usefully addressed by the specific, pre-defined information available in the documents.** Refrain from calling this agent if the documents are unlikely to contain the precise information needed, or if the question is a general query or requires current, real-time data better suited for an internet search.
