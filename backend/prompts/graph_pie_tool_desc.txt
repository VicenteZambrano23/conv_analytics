Pie Chart Visualization Tool

This tool renders a pie chart in the user interface based on query results from the SQLite database. It visualizes proportional relationships between parts of a whole, showing how different categories contribute to a total.

Parameters:
- query: A valid SQLite SELECT statement that returns exactly two columns:
  * First column: Category names for the pie segments (text/categorical data)
  * Second column: Numeric values representing the size of each segment (must be positive numbers)
- title: A descriptive chart title explaining what the proportional relationship represents

Returns:
- A rendered pie chart displayed in the user interface
- Each category is represented as a slice of the pie with a distinct color
- The size of each slice is proportional to its value relative to the total sum
- Categories and their percentage contributions are displayed in a legend
- Also a summary of the data displayed and if the graphic is correctly added

Usage:
graph_pie_tool(
  "SELECT CategoryName, SUM(Price * Quantity) AS Revenue FROM OrderDetails 
   JOIN Products ON OrderDetails.ProductID = Products.ProductID 
   JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID 
   GROUP BY CategoryName ORDER BY Revenue DESC LIMIT 8",
  "Revenue Distribution by Product Category"
)

Requirements:
- Query must return exactly 2 columns in the format: [(category1, value1), (category2, value2), ...]
- Results should be limited to 8 or fewer categories for optimal readability
- Values must be numeric and positive (representing counts, sums, or other aggregates)
- All values together should represent a meaningful whole
- Query should include ORDER BY [value] DESC to arrange segments from largest to smallest
- Small categories may be grouped as "Other" if they would create tiny, hard-to-read slices
