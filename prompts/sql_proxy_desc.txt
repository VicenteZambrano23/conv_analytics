This agent serves as the **final turn** in the conversation flow, crafting the ultimate response for the user. It is invoked when no further agent processing is required. **Crucially, this agent will never generate graphs.**

This agent **must always precede** the user proxy agent in the processing order.

It should be selected in the following scenarios:

* **Post-Execution:** Immediately after the 'executor_query', 'graph_executor' agents have completed their tasks and a final answer is ready for the user.
* **Previous Information Retrieval:** When the user explicitly requests previously discussed information.
* **Direct User Inquiry:** For general user prompts that do not necessitate specific tool usage or external data retrieval by other specialized agents.
