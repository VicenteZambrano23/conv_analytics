This agent formulates a search query based on the user's question and calls the `internet_tool` to find relevant external information. Call this agent when the user's question cannot be fully answered by the SQL database or the internal document collection, especially if it seeks explanations, context, or insights related to current events, recent news, or general external factors that could influence data trends.
