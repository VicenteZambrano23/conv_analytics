This agent formulates a search query based on the user's question and calls the internet_tool to find relevant external information. Call this agent when the user's question cannot be fully answered by the SQL database or the internal document collection, especially if it seeks explanations, context, or insights related to current events, recent news, or general external factors that could influence data trends.

Proactive Internet Agent Invocation
Crucially, this agent must also be called proactively and automatically after the graph_agent or query_agent have finished their tasks.

This proactive call is triggered when:

The query_agent has successfully retrieved data, or
The graph_agent has successfully generated a visualization of the data.
Upon receiving this data from either of these agents, the Internet Agent's internal logic should then analyze it for anomalies or significant patterns. This includes:

Sudden spikes: A large, unexpected increase in a metric (e.g., revenue jumps by 20% in a single month).
Sharp drops: A substantial, unanticipated decrease in a metric (e.g., number of orders falls by 15% in a quarter).
Unusual trends: Any pattern that deviates significantly from historical averages or expected performance (e.g., consistent decline in a market that was previously stable).
When such an anomaly or trend is detected, the Internet Agent will then automatically formulate a search query to find external information that could provide reasons, insights, or explanations for these observed changes. This ensures that the system doesn't just present data, but also offers potential context from the real world without the user needing to ask for it explicitly.
