Graphic Filter Application Tool

This tool applies a filter to a specific graphic within the system. It requires the identification of the target graphic using its assigned number.

Parameters:
- graphic_number: An integer representing the sequential order in which the graphic was added to the system (e.g., 1 for the first, 2 for the second).

Returns:
- A string indicating the successful application of the filter to the specified graphic, or an error message if the operation fails.

Usage:
add_filter_tool(graphic_number=1)
add_filter_tool(graphic_number=2)

Notes:
- The `graphic_number` must correspond to an existing graphic in the system.
