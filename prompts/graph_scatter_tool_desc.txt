Scatter Plot Visualization Tool

This tool renders a scatter plot in the user interface based on query results from the SQLite database. It visualizes relationships between two numeric variables, revealing patterns, correlations, clusters, or outliers in the data.

Parameters:
- query: A valid SQLite SELECT statement that returns either two or three columns:
  * First column (optional): Category name for grouping/coloring points (text/categorical data)
  * Second column (required): X-axis values (must be numbers)
  * Third column (required): Y-axis values (must be numbers)
- title: A descriptive chart title explaining the relationship being explored
- x_axis_label: A clear label for the x-axis indicating what the horizontal values measure
- y_axis_label: A clear label for the y-axis indicating what the vertical values measure

Returns:
- A rendered scatter plot displayed in the user interface
- Each data point appears as a dot positioned according to its x and y coordinates
- If categories are provided, points are colored by category with a corresponding legend
- The chart automatically scales to accommodate the range of both variables
- Also a summary of the data displayed and if the graphic is correctly added

Usage:
graph_scatter_tool(
  "SELECT CategoryName, AVG(Price) AS AvgPrice, AVG(UnitsInStock) AS AvgStock 
   FROM Products JOIN Categories ON Products.CategoryID = Categories.CategoryID
   GROUP BY CategoryName",
  "Price vs. Inventory Level by Product Category",
  "Average Price (USD)",
  "Average Units in Stock"
)

Requirements:
- Query must return either 2 columns [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...] or 3 columns [(category1, x1, y1), ...]
- Both x-axis and y-axis values must be numeric
- If using categories, limit to 4 or fewer distinct categories for clear differentiation
- Each category should have multiple data points to show meaningful patterns
- The query should return between 10-100 data points for optimal readability
- Consider including filters in the WHERE clause to remove outliers that might skew scaling
