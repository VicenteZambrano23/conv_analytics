This agent is responsible for adding filters to graphs within the system. It **must** be invoked whenever a user requests the application of a filter to a specific graphic. When calling this agent, ensure that the request clearly identifies the target graphic for the filter. The agent will then utilize its internal mechanisms (specifically, the `add_filter_tool`) to apply the filter accordingly.
