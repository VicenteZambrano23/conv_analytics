Bar Chart Visualization Tool

This tool renders a bar chart in the user interface based on query results from the SQLite database. It visualizes categorical data comparisons, showing relationships between groups and their associated numeric values.

Parameters:
- query: A valid SQLite SELECT statement that returns exactly two columns:
  * First column: Categories for the x-axis (text/categorical data)
  * Second column: Numeric values for the y-axis (must be numbers)
- title: A descriptive chart title explaining what the visualization represents
- y_axis_label: A clear label for the y-axis indicating what the numeric values measure
Returns:
- A rendered bar chart displayed in the user interface
- The chart will automatically scale to accommodate the data
- Categories are displayed on the x-axis in the order specified by the query's ORDER BY clause
- Values are represented by the height of each bar according to the y-axis scale
- Also a summary of the data displayed and if the graphic is correctly added

Usage:
graph_bar_tool(
  "SELECT Category, COUNT(*) AS Total FROM Table GROUP BY Category ORDER BY Total DESC LIMIT 10",
  "Distribution of Items by Category",
  "Number of Items"
)

Requirements:
- Query must return exactly 2 columns in the format: [(category1, value1), (category2, value2), ...]
- Results should be limited to 10 or fewer categories for optimal readability
- Values must be numeric and non-negative
- Query should include ORDER BY to arrange bars in a meaningful sequence (typically descending by value)
