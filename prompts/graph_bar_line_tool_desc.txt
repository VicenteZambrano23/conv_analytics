Mixed Bar Line Chart Visualization Tool

This tool renders a mixed bar line chart in the user interface based on query results from the SQLite database. It visualizes categorical data comparisons, showing relationships between groups and their associated numeric values of two different variables.

Parameters:
- query: A valid SQLite SELECT statement that returns exactly three columns:
  * First column: Categories for the x-axis (text/categorical data)
  * Second column: Numeric values for the y-bar-axis (must be numbers)
  * Third column: Numeric values for the y-line-axis (must be numbers)
- title: A descriptive chart title explaining what the visualization represents
- y_bar_axis_label: A clear label for the y-bar-axis indicating what the numeric values measure
- y_line_axis_label: A clear label for the y-line-axis indicating what the numeric values measure
Returns:
- A rendered mixed bar-line chart displayed in the user interface
- The chart will automatically scale to accommodate the data
- Categories are displayed on the x-axis in the order specified by the query's ORDER BY clause
- Values are represented by the height of each bar according to the y-bar-axis scale
- Also a summary of the data displayed and if the graphic is correctly added

Usage:
graph_bar_tool(
  "SELECT Category, COUNT(*) AS Total FROM Table GROUP BY Category ORDER BY Total DESC LIMIT 10",
  "Distribution of Items by Category",
  "Number of Items"
)

Requirements:
- Query must return exactly 3 columns in the format: [(category1, valuebar1, valueline1), (category2, valuebar2, valueline2), ...]
- Results should be limited to 10 or fewer categories for optimal readability
- Values must be numeric and non-negative
- Query should include ORDER BY to arrange bars in a meaningful sequence (typically descending by value)
