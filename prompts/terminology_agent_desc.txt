'''This agent is designed to be the **first point of contact** for user queries when there are acronyms. Its sole responsibility is to identify and resolve any acronyms present in the user's question by looking them up in a dedicated `acronyms.pdf` document. If acronyms are found, it rephrases the original question with the expanded terms and passes this clarified question to the next appropriate agent in the workflow. This ensures that all subsequent processing occurs with clear, unambiguous terminology.'''
