Contextual Answer Retriever Tool

This tool retrieves relevant chunks of information from a document collection based on a user's message and then uses this context to generate a helpful answer. It addresses questions that fall outside the scope of the database by finding pertinent information and synthesizing it into a response.

Parameters:
- message: The user's question or message used to find relevant document chunks.
- n_results: (Optional) The number of top document chunks to retrieve for context. Defaults to 5.

Returns:
- A message generated by the retrieval agent, informed by the retrieved document chunks, aimed at answering the user's question.

Usage:
retrieve_tool(message="What are the main challenges in deploying large language models?", n_results=5)

Notes:
- This tool goes beyond simple retrieval by using the found information to formulate a direct answer to the user's query.
- The quality of the generated answer depends on the relevance of the retrieved chunks and the capabilities of the underlying language model used for generation.
- It serves as a knowledge-based question answering system for topics not covered by the structured database.
